# sign-language-recognition
Developed a Sign Language Recognition System using computer vision to detect and interpret alphabets and basic words. Utilized machine learning models to process hand gestures for real-time recognition.
Sign language is an essential means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project aims to develop a system capable of capturing, processing, and identifying sign language gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

The system currently includes support for:

Collecting hand gesture data
Performing basic testing and validation
Providing a scalable base for future real-time gesture recognition enhancements"

**Technologies Used:**
Python

NumPy

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras

Machine Learning & Deep Learning concepts

**Features:**
Collection of hand gesture datasets.

Gesture recognition powered by machine learning algorithms.

Flexible design that allows easy expansion to real-time webcam-based usage.

**Future Enhancements:**
Live sign language recognition through webcam input.

Integration of MediaPipe for precise and reliable hand tracking.

Translation of recognized gestures into text or speech output.

Enhanced recognition accuracy using advanced deep learning techniques
